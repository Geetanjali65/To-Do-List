# To-Do List

A simple console-based **To-Do List App** built in **Java**. The application allows users to manage their tasks by adding, removing, and marking tasks as completed. It demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and **File I/O** for data persistence.

## Features:
- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the list with a description.
- **Mark Tasks as Complete**: Users can mark tasks as completed once theyâ€™re done.
- **Remove Tasks**: Users can delete tasks from the list.
- **View Tasks**: Users can view all tasks, including pending and completed tasks.
- **Save Data**: All tasks are saved to a file and can be reloaded the next time the app is run.

## Technologies Used:
- **Java** for backend logic and OOP principles.
- **File I/O** for data persistence (storing tasks in a file).
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts like **Classes**, **Objects**, and **Methods**.
